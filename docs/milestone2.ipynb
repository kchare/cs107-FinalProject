Many scientific and social scientific fields rely on probabilistic and statistical methodologies that fundamentally concern the optimization of some function, often called an objective function or a cost function. Intuitively, these methods seek to find the best fit of some function given observed data. Two common point estimators in data-driven fields are Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) from Frequentist's view and Maximum A Posterior (MAP) from Bayesian's view. In each case, the optimum points are identified by the stationary condition (first order derivative equals 0) and convexity check by higher order derivatives. Generally, a major branch of modern optimization methods, like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm(BFGS), are established via the first or higher order gradient of target function, thus heavily relies on an efficient gradient computation.\n\nAuto Differentiation (AD) is one highly effective method for calculation of the gradient function at some point. The method, which balances the efficiency of numeric computation and the precision of symbolic derivatives, is commonly used for optimization applications. Our library solves the optimization problem described above via gradient descent, which is implemented on top of a forward-mode autodifferentiation. The advance of this method is that AD can effectively and efficiently compute the Jacobian matrix. For the optimization problems we consider, the multidimensional nature of the challenge necessarily lends itself to the use of AD.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00001-e31809c1-9374-4d9a-8029-bc7c2112e11e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Background\nAt it’s heart, automatic differentiation (AD) seeks to calculate the derivative of some function, and evaluate both the function and the derivative, at a given point by iteratively applying the chain rule to a composition of elementary functions whose derivatives are well-known. This application of the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) is essential. By viewing a more complex function as simply the composition of many elementary functions, the calculation of the derivative becomes a series of steps, starting from the innermost function in the forward mode of AD. In each step, the chain rule is applied. For $z(y(x))$:\n\n$$ \\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dy} \\frac{dy}{dx} $$\n\nImportantly, because $z(y)$ will be an elementary function (e.g. addition, subtraction, sine, cosine), its derivative can be easily calculated. As we have begun at the innermost derivative, that function $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is known and can be used to iteratively calculate the derivative of the composition. For the simple example above, there are only two elementary operations, but this method can be extended to cover many elementary operations. One only needs to keep track of the derivative of each ‘running’ piece.\n\nThe method can be implemented through a graph structure (see below for a simple example), with each node in the graph, which represents a single elementary operation. This computational graph is especially important when the function of interest relies on multiple elements (e.g. $f(x,y) = x^2 + \\sin(y)$). One particular advantage of the elementary operations in this method is that each type of operation has a known derivative that can be calculated systematically and efficiently. At each step in the forward mode, the algorithm only needs to maintain the status of the derivative (potentially multiple partial derivatives in the case of multiple elements) as well as the current value of the function.\n\nThese storage requirements and iterative nature take advantage of a computer’s ability to store many values and perform many simple operations very quickly. One challenge for computers in calculating complex, symbolic derivatives is that symbolic differentiation may lead to enormous equations and syntactical rules that are highly complex to apply. For humans with a pen and paper, the AD approach may take too much time. The number of calculations, albeit simple, would certainly overwhelm the ability of most people to simply calculate the symbolic derivatives and implement a single evaluation. That concern is severely attenuated by computers. Additionally, AD is superior to the finite differences method of differentiation due to the fact that it is able to keep track of derivatives and functions at the level of machine precision. In scientific applications, this feature is incredibly important, as the sensitive systems measured or engineered will not be successful with only generalities.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00002-a125ce45-cead-4463-8d00-3df6f6a9820f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installation of boomdiff\nBelow are instructions for the download and installation of the *boomdiff* package.

This class is essentially the object or function to be evaluated and differentiated.\n    - While the actual object must be separately called (e.g. AD(2)), this can be wrapped into a single function line, as the class will be returned and operated on by other methods of the AD class.\n- Core classes:\n    - AD class: `AD(eval_pt, der_dict)`\n        - Arguments:\n            - `eval_pt`: Point to evaluate function at. Expected behavior as float or int; required.\n            - `der_dict`: Optional. Dictionary to support dictionary for object of multiple variables. Default behavior will be to assume that function is one variable (i.e. x1) and that its derivative is 1. Currently does not support multiple variables, though variable name passed to `der_dict` could, in theory, be any string.\n        - Attributes:\n            - `func_val`: value of function as a float; this will initally be the `eval_pt` passed at class initialization.\n            - `partial_dict`: dictionary. This dictionary will store the partial derivatives. Each key corresponds to the variable (in a multiple variable function). Note that the multiple variable functionality has not been fully implemented and tested.\n         - Elementary functions:\n             - These methods are executed in two manners, depending on the function type. Functions which have Python built-ins have been overloaded. Other elementary functions have been implemented as class static methods. Please see below for greater details.\n             - Overloaded:\n                 - Addition (`+`)\n                 - Subtraction (`-`)\n                 - Multiplication (`*`)\n                 - Power (`**`)\n                 - Division (`/`)\n                 - Negation (`-x`), where x is an instance of AD.\n                 \n             - Static methods:\n                 - Sine (`AD.sin()`)\n                 - Cosine (`AD.cos()`)\n                 - Tangent (`AD.tan()`)\n                 - Natural logarithm (`AD.log()`)\n                 - Exponential (base e) (`AD.exp()`)\n                 \n             - To be added:\n                 - Inverse trigonometric\n                 - Hyperbolic\n                 - Inverse hyperbolic\n                 - TBD\n                 \n        - Other methods:\n                 \n- External dependencies:\n    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n\n#### Optimizer (Future Feature)\n- Core data structures:\n    - Class for objective function\n    - Create function & AD class. With operation overloading, this will be used to 'recreate' the objective function from the inside out. The function class will inherit from the AD class and will allow user to specify the function.\n    - Potentially class for specific methods (could also use a class method to construct objective function class)\n- Classes\n    - ObjectiveFunction\n        - Methods\n            - set_function(): allows user to set objective function\n                - Validation that function\n            - optimize(method={'graddesc', etc): run optimization; return value of optimization\n            - from_X(): where 'X' represents some preset function\n        - Attributes:\n            - data\n            - functional_form\n    - boom-diff\n        - AD()\n            - Attributes:\n                - `func_string`: string; representation of function\n                - `evaluation_point`: numpy-array; point to evaluate. Note that length of array will dictate the following dictionary, and thus the number of partial derivatives. For example, consider $f(x_1, x_2)$. Any point of evaluation will consist of two real values, allowing for a dictionary of length 2.\n                - `func_val`: float; value of the function at the 'evaluation_point'\n                - `partial_dict`: dictionary; each key in this dictionary will correspond to the point to consider. We intend to restrict this to be $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ for notational ease. See below for example of partial dictionary for two variables:\n  \n                      `self.partial_dict = {'d_x1': 2.3, 'd_x2': 12.9}`\n            - Methods:\n                - Operator overloading for common methods: addition, subtraction, multiplication, power, division\n                - Additional functions for implementation of elementary operations (sin, cosine, exponential, logarithms)\n                    - Intend to restrict this class of functions; parse for string\n                - `__init__` method will require only an evaluation point; string representation will be set to default of blank string.\n                - Additional class method (title TBD, tentatively `from_str`): construct function representation from string.
