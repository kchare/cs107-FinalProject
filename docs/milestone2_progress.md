## Milestone 2B - Progress report

Since submission of Milestone 1, we have outlined the following workplan to meet the requirements for Milestone 2. For each of the tasks listed below, we have listed the group member responsible for implementation, as well as the status as of approximately 5PM EST on 11/12/2020. In the interest of brevity in the progress report, many of these tasks have not been subdivided, leading to a distinction between `to be started` and `work in progress` (with the latter representing significant progress but not completion). One additional caveat is that a few of our static methods have been implemented for only a single variable, but may be reflected as `Complete`.

One final note: we have been implementing our development to the ‘version-0’ branch, and intend to merge this into ‘main’ once completed.
