## Team Boomdiff - Final Milestone

Broadly, there are four areas still left to implement for the final milestone, each of which will require updated testing;

- Optimization library implementation
- Updated documentation/packaging
- Additional forward-mode requirements - functions with multiple vector/scalar inputs
- Deliverables
  - Broader impact statement
  - Video

The breakdown for grading for these sections is as follows:

| Points | Task                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 20     | Complete forward mode implementation |
| 15     | Documentation & Test Suite           |
| 4      | Broader Impact Statement             |
| 20     | Video presentation                   |
| 30     | New feature (optimization library)   |
| 15     | Code quality                         |

In terms of tasks remaining, we have the following:
